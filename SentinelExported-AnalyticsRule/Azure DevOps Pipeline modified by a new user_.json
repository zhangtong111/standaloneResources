A likely attacker path is the modification to an existing pipeline that they have access to. \nThis detection looks for users modifying a pipeline when they have not previously been observed modifying or creating that pipeline before. This query also joins events with data to Azure AD Identity Protection (AAD IdP) \nin order to show if the user conducting the action has any associated AAD IdP alerts. You can also choose to filter this detection to only alert when the user also has AAD IdP alerts associated with them.",
